        <h1>Ordin@trix 23</h1>
        <p>
          It all started 17 years ago. A fusion of creativity, talent and skill
          is what Ordin@trix is all about. Ordin@trix has evolved through the
          years moving from an interschool festival at the state level to an
          international event. Over the years we have had students from China,
          Muscat, Japan and other countries as regular participants.<br />
          The event has witnessed gracious presence of celebrities like Mr. Amol
          Gupte and Miss Manju Singh apart from experts from various technical
          fields. The movies showcased here have been screened at the movie
          festivals by PVR Cinemas and CHINH India Festival.
